**Influence of climate hazards on conflicts in kenya**
-This repository contains code that is used to carry out spatial analysis for investigating influence of climate hazards on conflicts in kenya

-R programming language is used

-Interaction.R contains every line of code used

-It is subdivided into sections based on the task being carried out

-Comments have been indicated so as to give information on what is being done

-Various R packages were used to carry out the tasks.

-The following steps were followed to achieve the goal
**Question one & two**
***Provides an analytical way to explore the interaction between climate hazards events and conflict***
**Link socio-economic vulnerabilities present in areas which are exposed to climatic and/or conflict hazards to illustrate the most vulnerable areas to climate induced insecurities and risks. Lastly, identify groups vulnerable to climate and security risks that should be targeted for interventions.**

-Loading packages and reading rds R file

-Access individual raster objects from raster stack object

-Calculate total sum value of climate data 

-Check data normal distribution using hist function

-Carry out linear regression for :
    -Climate hazards(independent variable) and conflict(dependent variable)
    -Socioeconomic vulnerabilities (independent variable) and conflicts(dependent variable)
    -linear regression for climate(independent variable) versus socioeconomic(dependent variable)

-Summary outputs of models were visualized

-Overlay analysis was carried out to determine the most vulnerable areas

-Vulnerability map was plotted using plot function
